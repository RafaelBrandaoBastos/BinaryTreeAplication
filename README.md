# Binary Tree
<p align="justify">
A binary tree is a rooted tree that is also an ordered tree in which every node has at most two children. A rooted tree naturally imparts a notion of levels (distance from the root), thus for every node a notion of children may be defined as the nodes connected to it a level below.

The tree is implemented in a phonebook, which each node contains a name and a phone number. I used insertion, remotion and search methods based in string comparison, also traversal paths for visualization.

Ps. Code only works if list.txt is not empty and follows the list file format.
