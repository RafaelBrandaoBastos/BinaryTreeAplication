# Binary Tree
<p align="justify">
A binary tree is a rooted tree that is also an ordered tree (a.k.a. plane tree) in which every node has at most two children. A rooted tree naturally imparts a notion of levels (distance from the root), thus for every node a notion of children may be defined as the nodes connected to it a level below.

 The tree is implemented in a phonebook, which each node contains a name and a phone number. Insertion, remotion and search methods are used based in string comparison. Also uses traversal paths for visualization.
